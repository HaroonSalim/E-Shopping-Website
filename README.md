# E-Shopping Website – Alibaba Homepage Clone

This project is a front-end clone of the **Alibaba** homepage, built for practice and to gain front-end development experience. It replicates the user interface of Alibaba, a popular e-commerce platform for buying and selling products.

## 🛍️ What is Alibaba?

**Alibaba** is a leading global online marketplace that connects buyers and suppliers across a wide range of product categories. It primarily serves as a B2B (business-to-business) platform, enabling bulk purchasing and direct communication between businesses.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Sass**
- **Bootstrap 4**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**

## 📦 Notes

- The main script file is `index.js`, written using ECMAScript 6 (ES6).
- For better browser compatibility, the ES6 code is transpiled to ES5 using **Babel**, and the resulting output is stored in `script.js`.
